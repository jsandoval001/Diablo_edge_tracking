# Diablo_edge_tracking

Diablo is an open-source CFD solver, originally developed by John Taylor and Tom Bewley and others at UCSD. It solves the incompressible, Boussinesq Navier-Stokes equations in several simple geometries (extract from https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/jrt51/ and https://github.com/johnryantaylor/DIABLO).

This is a version adapted by Dr Tom Eaves from the University of Dundee, which is set up to solve the unsteady flow in a Stokes oscillating boundary layer. The code was adapted by Jorge Sandoval, PDRA at the University of Dundee, to incorporate an Edge-Tracking algorithm based on the Kinetic Energy associated to a perturbation velocity field from the laminar exact solution.
